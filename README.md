Number On Your Way (NOYW) is a simple memory game to be played by commuters (who are not driving). 

#### Rules of the game


1. Game starts when you start from office/home.
2. Look at a vehicle's number plate.
3. Choose a two digit number from number plate. For ex, 4356 you can choose between 43 or 56.
4. Lets say you selected 43. Goal is to find 10 different vehicles with numbers 40 to 49.
5. Then you start looking at other vehicle with number plate with pattern 4X++. For ex if 4178, then note it in you memory.
6. Keep looking for number as vehicle pass by.

Note: Other than your eyes and brain, you shouldnt use tools like paper/pen to note numbers.
